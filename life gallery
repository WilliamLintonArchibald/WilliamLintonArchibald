On the 2nd of June 1983, William Linton was born in the quaint town of Stratford, Warwickshire, England - renowned as the birthplace of Shakespeare. His academic journey led him to Dartmouth College in 2000, where he immersed himself in the study of psychology and social sciences. Remarkably, at the tender age of 20 in 2003, Linton unveiled his groundbreaking work "2D-world" whilst still at university. He delved into the realm of social relationship attributes in Asia from 2005 and presented his masterpiece, "Ocean in My Mind," in 2007. The enigmatic black and white oil painting, "Woman in Solitude," captured public attention in 2011. Linton made his debut in the American art scene in 2018, marking a significant milestone in his career. His profound interest in exploring the lives of marginalized communities is evident in his notable work "Fair," completed in 2015. Over the decade spanning from 2010 to 2020, Linton passionately created a multitude of oil paintings and installations, alongside engaging in various small-scale performance art projects across Asia.
